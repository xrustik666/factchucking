# Chuck Norris facts generator

I'm going to make a Chuck Norris facts generator app.  I will use this API for this:
https://api.chucknorris.io/
The application will have an adaptive layout and a minimalistic but stylish design.
Also there is a requirement to provide company brand/design that will be used. The visual of other companies will not be used, I want to make my own.
Here is the functionality of the site:

Must-haves:
1. A random joke will be displayed on the main page.
2. The user will be able to select a category
3. By pressing the R key, the user will see a new joke
4. The user will be able to search for jokes by keywords
5. The user will be able to add their favorite jokes to favorites. This will be implemented through the React functionality

Nice-to-haves:
1. The user will be able to subscribe. Every week, a random joke will be sent to his email.
2. Authentication will be implemented on the site.
3. Jokes added to favorites will be added to the database via the back-end
